# P.E.P.P.E.R.

## Inspiration
Many seniors in our lives lack strong social connection and friendships with others. Our project goal was to help combat this issue using emerging technologies​ so that they never have to spend their day-to-day life alone. This project will contribute to the support of health-care workers and care takers as they are not always able to provide the care and attention that everyone deserves

## How we built it
- Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Google Cloud Functions and OpenAI API

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Taking an idea that tackles issues that are very common yet brushed under the rug and bringing it to reality
- Being able to get our foot through the door in exploring the endless possibilities AI has to offer for the world
- Having a working full-stack application with limited to no experience

## Challenges we ran into
- Configuring frontend application such that it was functional and efficient
- Setting up the cloud service such that it effectively communicates with OpenAI API and format the response for the client to use

## What's next for P.E.P.P.E.R.
- Incorporating visual and responsive persona coupled with voice capabilities to humanize the chatbot​
- Incorporate feedback from our target audience when releasing future versions of the application.
